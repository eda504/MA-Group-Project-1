    <h2>Here are some tips for what to do if you lose your pet or find a missing pet!</h2>
    <div class="tip-box">
    <h3><li>1. Report Immediately.</li></h3>
    </div>
    <p>If you lose your pet, report it to a shelter immediately, and be sure to leave your contact information along with a photo of your pet.</p>
      <div class="tip-box">
    <h3><li>2. Flyers</li></h3>
    </div>
    
    <p>When your pet is missing, it is good to put up flyers with descriptions/photos of your pet and your contact information in case someone spots your pet, so that they can return it back to you. </p>
     <div class="tip-box">
    <h3><li>3. Calm Consistency</li></h3>
    </div>
    <p>Keep trying to find your pet, and don't give up hope. Some pets are found days or weeks after reported missing.</p>
     <div class="tip-box"><h3><li>4. Set up familiar scents</li></h3></div>
    <p>Leave out their bed, litter box, or your worn clothing outside, the smell might make them come back</p>
